# Capture_attacks_using_honeypots
This code run as a service and monitoring all sysmon event logs and take action based on events generated by attacker's activities. Upload all dropped and created malwares, files. This capture all commands executed by attacker on a system. This can be deployed in production as well in honeypot systems to monitor attack activities. I have connected this service with two telegram bots which is monitoring all logs and RDP connection. Also APIGEOLOCATION API is using to get the location of attacker in order to correlate attackers. 

## Key Features of Service

* Runs as a Windows service, ensuring continuous and unobtrusive monitoring without user intervention.
Operates silently in the background, making it difficult for attackers to detect.
Sysmon Event Log Monitoring:

* Continuously monitors Sysmon event logs to detect suspicious activities and attacks.
Captures a wide range of events, including process creations, network connections, file modifications, and more.
Uses predefined rules to identify malicious activities and respond accordingly.
Real-Time Action on Detected Events:

* Executes predefined actions based on the type of Sysmon events detected.
Actions can include terminating malicious processes, quarantining suspicious files, and alerting administrators.
File and Malware Handling:

* Automatically uploads all detected and created malware files to a secure location for further analysis.
Captures and stores all files dropped or created by attackers for forensic investigation.
Command Capture:

* Records all commands executed by attackers on the system.
Provides detailed logs of attacker activities, including command-line arguments and execution context.
Integration with Telegram Bots:

* Connects to two Telegram bots to provide real-time alerts and updates.
Telegram bots monitor all logs and RDP connections, ensuring administrators are promptly informed of suspicious activities.
Provides instant notifications for critical events, enabling quick response.
Geolocation Tracking:

* Utilizes the APIGEOLOCATION API to determine the geographical location of attackers.
Correlates attacker locations with attack patterns to enhance threat intelligence.
Provides context-aware responses based on the geographical origin of attacks.
